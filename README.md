Load MIDI file -> Markov Chain process -> new MIDI file

"Algorithmic Composer" is a C++ Mac program made in XCode for loading MIDI files and using the Markov Chain process to get a new MIDI file that sounds very similar to the original melodies.

We are using Craig Stuart Sapp's "midifile" library for reading and writing MIDI files: http://midifile.sapp.org/
